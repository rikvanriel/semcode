# semcode usage guide

All semcode functions are git aware and default to lookups on the current
commit.  You can also pass a specific commit you're interested in, or a branch name.

**Regex**: all patterns are case-insensitive; no `(?i)` needed.  Applies to
function names, commit messages, symbols, and lore email searches.

## Common parameters

- **git_sha**: commit to search (default: current)
- **branch**: branch name, resolved to its tip (e.g., "main"); takes
  precedence over git_sha if both are given
- **page**: pagination (1-based); pages are 50 lines of the tool's
  rendered text output, not 50 result records.  Omit for full results.
- **since_date / until_date**: e.g., "yesterday", "2 weeks ago",
  "2024-01-15"
- **\*_patterns**: arrays of regex.  `author_patterns`, `subject_patterns`,
  `from_patterns`, `body_patterns`, `recipients_patterns`,
  `symbols_patterns`, `path_patterns` are OR'd within an array.
  `regex_patterns` and `symbol_patterns` are AND'd within an array.

**Conventions**: boolean parameters default to `false`; `limit: 0`
means unlimited, except where the tool declares an explicit max --
in that case the max wins and `limit: 0` is rejected.

## Code lookup

In the call-graph tools below (`find_callers`, `find_calls`,
`find_callchain`), both sides of a call edge include functions and
function-like macros.

**find_function**: search for functions and macros
  - name: function/macro name, or a regex
  - also displays details on callers and callees
**find_type**: search for types and typedefs
  - name: type/typedef name or regex
**find_callers**: find callers (functions or macros) of the named entity
  - name: function or macro to search
  - also reports callers that reach it through a function pointer, with the
    evidence for each: a site that names it outright, or a member it is
    installed in whose receiver has the matching type. Sites that match on
    member name alone are reported as a count, not as answers
**find_implementors**: functions installed in a struct member
  - name: `type.member`, e.g. `file_operations.read`
  - answers "what can be called here?" for a dispatch through that member
**find_registrations**: where a function is installed as a callback
  - name: function to search
  - answers "who can reach this?", the reverse of find_implementors
**find_calls**: find callees (functions or macros) of the named entity
  - name: function or macro to search
**find_callchain**: complete call chain (forward and reverse)
  - name: function or macro to search
  - up_levels: number of caller levels to show (default: 2, 0 = unlimited)
  - down_levels: number of callee levels to show (default: 3, 0 = unlimited)
  - calls_limit: max calls to show per level (default: 15, 0 = unlimited)
**diff_functions**: extract functions and types from a unified diff
  - diff_content: unified diff text (e.g., output of `git diff`)
  - use this to determine which symbols are involved in a given diff

## Code search

**file_survey**: return compact Tree-sitter syntax facts for one workspace file
  - path: source path relative to the workspace
  - reports function/type definitions, calls, type mentions, and parse errors
  - omits basic scalar types such as `int`, `char`, `u8`, and `u64` from type
    mentions
  - definition tuples are `[name, count]`, where count is distinct git-aware
    callers or referrers across the indexed workspace
  - returns compact JSON without line numbers or pretty-printing
  - does not perform symbol resolution
**grep_functions**: search function/macro bodies for a regex
  - pattern: the regex to search for
  - verbose: if true, show full function bodies
  - path_pattern: optional regex to filter results by path
  - limit: max number of results (default: 100)
  - the search is already scoped to function and macro bodies; no
    need to anchor the pattern to constrain the search (regex
    metacharacters are NOT auto-escaped)
**vgrep_functions**: vector embedding search on functions/macros/types
  - query_text: text describing the kind of functions to find
  - path_pattern: optional regex to filter results by path
  - limit: max number of results (default: 10, max: 100)
  - only useful for broad concepts that a regex won't find well
  - the database might not have embeddings indexed

## Commit search

Note: commit tools use **`git_ref`** (not `git_sha` from the common
parameters) and **`symbol_patterns`** (singular; AND'd -- distinct
from lore's plural `symbols_patterns`, which is OR'd).  They do not
accept `since_date`/`until_date`; those date filters are lore-only.

Commit selection in `find_commit`: `git_ref` and `git_range` are
mutually exclusive.  `reachable_sha` is a filter that may accompany
either, or stand alone (with no `git_ref` or `git_range`) to mean
"all indexed commits reachable from this sha".

**find_commit**: search for changes, potentially in a range of commits
  - can return a large body of results; use pagination to manage context
  - git_ref: single commit ref (sha, short sha, branch, HEAD, etc.)
  - git_range: optional range for multiple commits, e.g., HEAD~10..HEAD
  - reachable_sha: optional git sha; filter to results reachable from it
  - regex_patterns (AND'd): applied against commit message + unified diff
  - symbol_patterns (AND'd): find commits changing a function or type
  - author_patterns, subject_patterns, path_patterns (each OR'd)
  - verbose: show full diff in addition to metadata
**vcommit_similar_commits**: search commits based on vector embeddings
  - query_text: search text
  - git_range: optional range, e.g., HEAD~10..HEAD
  - reachable_sha: optional git sha, reachable-from filter (combinable
    with git_range)
  - regex_patterns (AND'd), symbol_patterns (AND'd)
  - author_patterns, subject_patterns, path_patterns (each OR'd)
  - limit: max results (default 10, max 50)

## Lore (kernel mailing list archive)

Lore tools use **`symbols_patterns`** (plural; OR'd within the array --
distinct from commit tools' singular `symbol_patterns`, which is AND'd).
All `*_patterns` arrays below are OR'd within the array.

**lore_search**: search lore.kernel.org email archives
  - message_id: optional exact message ID for direct lookup
  - verbose: show full message body
  - show_thread: show full email thread for each match
  - show_replies: show replies/subthreads under each match
    (mutually exclusive with show_thread)
  - mbox: output in MBOX format with full headers and body
  - limit: max number of results (default: 100)
  - accepts: from_patterns, subject_patterns, body_patterns,
    symbols_patterns, recipients_patterns
**dig**: find lore.kernel.org emails related to a git commit
  - commit (required): git commit reference (SHA, short SHA, HEAD,
    branch name, etc.)
  - verbose: show full message body
  - show_all: show all duplicate results, not just most recent
  - show_thread: show full thread for each result (use with show_all)
  - show_replies: show replies/subthreads (use with show_all, mutually
    exclusive with show_thread)
**vlore_similar_emails**: semantic vector search over lore.kernel.org emails
  - query_text: text describing the kind of emails to find
  - limit: max number of results (default: 20, max: 100)
  - accepts: from_patterns, subject_patterns, body_patterns,
    symbols_patterns, recipients_patterns
  - the database might not have lore embeddings indexed

## Branch / status

**list_branches**: list indexed branches with indexed SHA and
  freshness (up-to-date vs. outdated against current tip).  No
  parameters.
**compare_branches**: compare two branches; shows merge base,
  ahead/behind status, and indexing status for both
  - branch1, branch2: branch names
**indexing_status**: show background indexing progress, errors,
  and timing.  No parameters.

## Lazy Loading

Start the server with `--lazy` to cut initial context ~96%.  The
server then exposes only three meta-tools (`list_categories`,
`get_tools`, `call_tool`); call them in that order to discover
and invoke full tools on demand.

## Recipes

### Locating a backported commit reachable from HEAD (or any other sha)

Repositories that heavily cherry-pick patches store the backport
under a different git sha than the upstream commit.  Search by
commit subject to find it, then narrow to commits reachable from
the branch tip with `reachable_sha`:

```
find_commit(regex_patterns=["bnxt_en: Fix memory corruption when FW resources change during ifdown"])
find_commit(regex_patterns=["bnxt_en: Fix memory corruption when FW resources change during ifdown"],
            reachable_sha="HEAD")
```
